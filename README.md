Last Days of Earth
---

This is an attempt at implementing a multiplayer point and click adventure game. It is being created for entry into #RainbowJam17

The engine has not been designed for security. It is assumed that if you're playing an adventure game you have some level of interest in solving the puzzles so we don't really care if you cheat.

It should be fairly easy to make your own multiplayer adventure game on top of the last days engine. All game-specific content is in the "game" directory. You should not need to touch the "engine" directory.

Once in production - the command "manage.py beat" should be run regularly (every 30 seconds or so) to perform periodic commands.
